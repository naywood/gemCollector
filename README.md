# Crystal Collector

https://naywood.github.io/gemCollector/

This is a game I created using JQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

I expect that I'll updates to this overtime to increase the "wow" factor.

The player is given a random "target score" at the app run
There are four crystals to click on
By clicking on a crystal it adds a specific amount of points to the total score.
The player wins the game by matching the total score to the random number. 
The player lost the game if the total score goes above the random number. 
The value of each crystal is unknown from the player until they do the math to see how their score is adding up.
